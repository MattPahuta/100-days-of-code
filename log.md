# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 13: January 29, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Continued work on the Meet landing page project, adding more styles and additional markup for the design spec.

**Thoughts** More of the same, working to get more efficient with CSS styling.


### Day 12: January 28, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Spent some time working through Scrimba, reviewing JS ES6, and then pivoted to revisiting another frontend mentor project, the Meet Landing Page.

**Thoughts** I really need to figure out how to start refining my process of starting a new web page project, particularly organizing the styles and custom properties. It's really time consuming and I know I'm not all that efficient. Continuing to do Frontend Mentor projects should really help here to get that muscle memory going and build some better habits.


### Day 11: January 27, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the guess-th-word game project from Skillcrush JS Fundamentals and published to GitHub pages. Most of the work was adding in the game reset/restart functionality, hooking up a new event listener, and some general code tiddying up. 

**Thoughts** This project was fun to see come to life, but did contain a fair amount of hand-holding. It will be good to try and recreate a similar web app away from the tutorial in order to help set some of the concepts in my mind.

### Day 10: January 26, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Nearly completed the Skillcrush word guessing game project, adding dynamic elements and most of the needed DOM features. More practice with loops, conditionals, string/array methods, and a bit of async functions. I should wrap this up tomorrow and get it uploaded to GitHub pages.

**Thoughts** Found that I tend to outthink myself when working through some of the logic in these projects, like reaching for more complex array methods when a more straightforward loop with a conditional is all I needed. I need to keep reminding myself to stick with the fundamentals and keep getting comfortable with those before trying to get too cute.

### Day 9: January 25, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Built most of the logic for a word guessing game using vanilla JavaScript, pulling together a lot of fundamental JS concepts and DOM manipulation.

**Thoughts** The Skillcrush project has been a good mix of fundamental JS concepts (arrays, functions, DOM manipulation, etc.) and giving me more practice at distilling problems down into smaller bits to tackle and then fitting it all together into a cohesive web app. Hoping to wrap up this project tomorrow.

### Day 8: January 24, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Finished module 5 of the Scrimba frontend dev career path with a few more responsive design challenges and a bit of JavaScript. Finished the the last two Skillcrush JS exercises, focussed on async/await functions, interacting with APIs.

**Thoughts**  Ready to start in on the next big Skillcrush JS project tomorrow, supplementing with continued work along the Scrimba path and Colt Steele's Udemy JS course. Looking forward to doing more project-oriented work in the weeks ahead.

### Day 7: January 23, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Worked through module 5 of the Scrimba frontend dev career path, responsive design challenges. 

**Thoughts** Starting to get more comfortable with CSS specificity principles and learned about a new CSS property, currentColor.


### Day 6: January 22, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Finished up that snake game over on Scrimba, which was the last bit of module 4 of the frontend dev path. Also checked out Just JavaScript (I'm intrigued) and moved some local VS code over to Codepen.

**Thoughts** Feeling pretty good about the Scrimba path and confident I'll be able to finish the whole thing within a couple months, give or take.

### Day 5: January 21, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Worked through about half of the Scrimba JS Fundamentals build a snake game project.

**Thoughts** Crunched for time today but managed about 1.5 hours of coding. I'll need to go back and take a closer look at the function we're using to manage the movement in the game. The math principles are simple enough, but some elements weren't quite clicking during the first pass.


### Day 4: January 20, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Continued to practice JS fundamentals with the Launch School JS100 prep exercises and worked through some async function exercises for the Skillcrush JavaScript course.

**Thoughts** Working with APIs, actually getting some dynamic data back from the JS code I write, turns out is pretty fun. Looking forward to nailing down the syntax with some more practice and figuring out some fun personal projects to work on.

### Day 2: January 18, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Review of async/await JavaScript via Skillcrush and some brushing up on CSS Grid with Wes Bos's Grid course and building a quick, responsive gallery with Grid, working off of Kevin Powell's YouTube channel offerings.

**Thoughts** Working with data through APIs is something I really need and want to focus on over the next few months. The Skillcrush course is providing a nice re-entry into some concepts I haven't looked at in a while.


### Day 1: January 17, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Kicked things off with a slew of exercises in the Skillcrush JavaScript module as well as some review of JS fundamentals with the Launch School JS prep material.

**Thoughts** New year, renewed commitment. Day one of a hundred days straight of coding in the books! A focus on sharpening my responsive design, CSS, modern JavaScript, and React skills are all in order. I've been working with HTML, CSS, and a little bit of JavaScript and jQuery for a while, but it's time to really commit to ramping up my code skills and moving beyond the basics, heading toward a new career in software development.
