# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 73: April 2, Saturday

**Today's Progress**:

**Thoughts**


### Day 72: April 6, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: A lot of course work through the Scrimba path today as well as some free code camp. 

**Thoughts** I've been neglecting updating this log the last few days, so I'll just have to tack on an extra week or so, I think.

### Day 71: March 31, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Made good progress on both the the momentum clone and the movie watchlist app today.

**Thoughts** The CSS for populating the movie watchlist is way more time consuming than the actual pulling data from the API, but it's fun to see the end product on the screen. The Momentum clone is great practice, reinforcing how promises work and adding in some error catching. 

### Day 70: March 30, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: With not much time today, worked on the Free Code Camp curriculum, making my ways through the JS algorithm and data structures track.

**Thoughts** Back to projects tomorrow.

### Day 69: March 29, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Worked mainly with the Scrimba material today, building out a Momentum browser extension clone with several APIs and vanilla JS.

**Thoughts** Interacting with real data coming back from these APIs is great fun. It's one of the parts of working with JavaScript that reinforces how much I love the web development stuff.


### Day 68: March 28, Monday

**Today's Progress**: More progress through the free code camp JS curriculum, solving a handful of algorithm challenges as well as some general CSS study/research.

**Thoughts** Limited bandwidth today so no full-fledged project work. 

### Day 67: March 26, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Another hour of JavaScript challenges over at free code camp and then a couple working on the movie watchlist app, primarily styling up the search form and planning out the movie results cards.

**Thoughts** The CSS to get everything looking good will easily take three or four times as long for me than the JS that pulls and manipulates the data.

### Day 66: March 25, Friday

**Today's Progress**: A few more challenges in the books over at free code camp but the bulk of my day was dedicated to starting the movie watchlist app in earnest. Wired up API calls, refined the data coming back, and planned out the other functions and DOM manipulation I'll need to incorporate.

**Thoughts** This movie watchlist project is going to be more substantial than I initially thought. The API calls are straightforward and local storage shouldn't be too much trouble, but the finer details of the UI, like indicated which movies are already on the watchlist, might prove a bit tricky. 

### Day 65: March 24, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Spent some time getting through the JavaScript algorithm challenges over at free code camp and started in on the next Scrimba solo project; A movie watchlist creator using the Open Movie DB API and local storage. 

**Thoughts** This movie watchlist project looks like it's going to be fun but I'll need to brush up again on utilizing local storage. I remember it's fairly simple but I just haven't used it that frequently. It'll be good practice all around.


### Day 64: March 23, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Finished the card game tutorial over at scrimba, working with API data and some basic DOM manipulation.

**Thoughts** Light day today but ready to start a new project tomorrow.


### Day 63: March 22, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: More time over at free code camp today working through javascript algorithm challenges before spending some good time working through the scrimba path, working with async functions and getting a better handle on how promises work. 

**Thoughts** This was a ramp up day, getting some required building block tasks going before starting in on my next significant project, probably over at frontend mentor.

### Day 62: March 21, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Started in on the next module of the Scrimba program today, focusing on callback function work and building toward async functions. Also put in an hour of work over at free code camp.

**Thoughts** Limited time and energy for this today, but feeling optimistic about the week ahead.


### Day 61: March 20, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Finished up the color generator project today, adding the click-to-copy functionality and tightening up the markup, styles, and JS.

**Thoughts** I'm really pleased to have finished this one without too much trouble and am reasonably happy with the final product. It's not quite portfolio quality yet, but a little more polish can get it to that level, I think. All in all, glad to be moving forward to the next thing.

2. [Live Vercel URL](https://color-scheme-generator-iota.vercel.app/)

### Day 60: March 19, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: More work on the color scheme generator app, getting the API call and markup generation working well. Also resived the layout and styles, working to tighten things up.

**Thoughts** Using just standard fetch API for this one since that's where we're at in the Scrimba curriculum. Having worked with async functions a bit I can see how this app could potentially work better. 


### Day 59: March 18, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Worked more on the Scrimba solo project, a color scheme generator using the color API. 

**Thoughts** Low energy and low bandwidth day today, but did manage to work out the basic logic I need to make the app work. Just need to cleanup the code, sort out the DOM manipuluation, and make it prettier. Hopefully I'll get to all that this weekend.


### Day 58: March 17, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Finished the final portion of the Scrimba 'build an RPG' course, introducing Classes and replacing the previous iteration of the character constructor function with a Class. Also revisited the Udemy web dev course with Colt Steele, reviewing the API module and beginning to prep for the next solo Scrimba project - a color scheme generator that pulls from The Color API.

**Thoughts** It'll take a good deal more practice to get the hang of using Classes but I can already begin to see just how valuable they can be, making code more modular, and preparing to dive into React. 


### Day 57: March 16, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Polished off the testimonials grid project as well as finishing off part 3 of 4 of the Scrimba 'build and RPG' course, learning and practicing modern JS techniques. Also spent some time on the FCC JS curriculum.

**Thoughts** The frontend mentor mini-project was good to reset my Grid layout techniques and I'm feeling good about getting close to turning the page with the Scrimba path, moving on to the next sections soon.

2. [Live Vercel URL](https://testimonials-grid-swart.vercel.app/)


### Day 56: March 15, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: More work on the Scrimba path today as well as a quick frontend mentor project to practice Grid fundamentals.

**Thoughts** After ending up with a much too complex set of Grid parameters on my last project, the smaller Grid project was helpful to reset some of my understanding around the concept and remember to always start as simply as possible.


### Day 55: March 14, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Got back to the Scrimba path today as well as the FCC curriculum.  Also started another frontend mentor project.

**Thoughts** Took the day off yesterday partially due to the daylight saving time change and found it was tough ramping back up today. Looking forward to more focused work as the week goes on.


### Day 54: March 12, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Typemaster frontend mentor project.

**Thoughts** Really pleased to be done with this one.

2. [GitHub Pages Live URL](https://mattpahuta.github.io/typemaster-landing-page/)


### Day 53: March 11, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Just a couple of hours available today, but did manage to knock off the mobile and tablet layouts for the typemaster project.

**Thoughts** CSS can be the devil sometimes. I've gone around in circles with some of the positioning of elements with this design and often times ended up with the simpler of the options tried. Looking forward to getting this project behind me and making JavaScript a focus again.


### Day 52: March 10, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: More time into the typemaster site today, finally getting the majority of the grid layouts sorted. Also another hour of Scrimba plus some time on the Skillcrush slack channel, helping a peer.

**Thoughts** Looking forward to finishing the typemaster site and putting it behind me. I really enjoy helping others in the slack channel or on discord, so there's an extra level of motivation to get proficient in JS and other topics so I can continue to help out others.


### Day 51: March 9, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: All my time devoted to the typemaster website today.

**Thoughts** Really went down the rabbit hole with Grid today and don't have a lot to show for it. Frustrating week.


### Day 50: March 8, Tueday

**Today's Progress**: Finished off the second part of four for the latest Scrimba module and spent more time on the Typemaster project.

**Thoughts** Rough day. Sleep deprived and felt frustrated by my attempts to make a Grid layout work properly. Back at it tomorrow.

### Day 49: March 7, Monday

**Today's Progress**: More progress along the Scrimba path today, working with Constructor functions to create a more modular code base.

**Thoughts** Working with the Constructor functions and destructuring objects is turning out to quite a bit of fun. They're going to be hugely important as I move toward building more complex apps.

### Day 48: March 6, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Spent some time checking in on the Wes Bos JS course, building out a image gallery with a modal, plus another hour-plus work on the Typemaster website project, sorting out most of the markup and figuring out how to organize the grid setup.

**Thoughts** The typemaster project is deceptively complex, as far as the various grid layouts need to be for the various screen sizes. It's definitely a challenge.

### Day 47: March 5, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: About an hour working through the Scrimba path, practicing Object destructuring, Array constructors, map, join, and fill methods. Also about an hour working on the Typemaster frontend mentor project, mainly setting up design system styles and preping for the rest of the site build.

**Thoughts** These early stages of the website projects always feel time consuming. I'll need to work on setting up a more robust set of templates to get things off the ground a bit faster.


### Day 46: March 4, Friday

**Today's Progress**: More progress along the Scrimba path today as well as another couple of Steph E video tutorials on egghead.io. Also a bit of work on one of the two frontend mentor projects I've started.

**Thoughts** Hit a bit of a lull in my progress these last two days, but I think I can regain my focus soon. Spreading myself too thin this last week hasn't helped.


### Day 45: March 3, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: A lot of miscellaneous stuff today including some CSS videos from Steph Eckles, a bit more along the Scrimba FEWD path, and getting started on another Frontend Mentor project.

**Thoughts** Looking forward to a bit more focus of effort tomorrow.


### Day 44: March 2, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Finished the invoice creator Scrimba project today. 

**Thoughts** I feel like I totally over-engineered this project and had to stop and start several different methods before getting it all done, but it was good practice with a variety of JS concepts, particularly array methods, working with objects, and DOM manipulation.

### Day 43: March 1, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Wes Bos JS project and started in on the next Scrimba solo project, the invoice creator.

**Thoughts** The layout of the invoice creator was deceptively complex and took a while to lay all the styles and markup groundwork. I'll start in on the logic tomorrow, taking a lot of the lessons from the last Wes Bos project and applying them here.


### Day 42: February 28, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Success! Figured out the one-click copy for the password generator, using the navigator.clipboard method for the first time. That was a nice win. Also started another small project through the Wes Bos Beginner JS course, a shopping form (todo list) that's turning out to be a good refresher on a variety of topics.

**Thoughts** The Wes Bos project will be a good precursor to a similar project that's up next in the Scrimba path.


### Day 41: February 27, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Added a pw length selection field and functionality to the pw generator.

**Thoughts** Spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to implement a one-click copy function for the generated pws. Think I've go it now, but still need to implement in the project.

### Day 40: February 26, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Built a simple password generator for the Scrimba path, practicing some array methods and Math.random().

**Thoughts** Another slow day today but I have high hopes for the week ahead.

### Day 39: February 25, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Tweaked the unit conversion app to make it dynamic, adding a form input for user to enter any number value. It's still very rudimentary, but basically functional and something that can be built upon later for similar projects. A bit more progress on the Scrimba API module as well.

**Thoughts** A relatively light day today. Looking forward to getting back at it tomorrow.


### Day 38: February 24, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Finished up regular expressions on free code camp and completed a small Scrimba project, a unit conversion web app (still need to make it dynamic).

**Thoughts** Retaining what was covered in the regex module is going to be impossible. I understand the methodology, but will need a lot of practice to really get the hang of employing them in my work.


### Day 37: February 23, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Built a random quote generator web app, connecting to an API, as part of the zero to mastery JS projects course.

**Thoughts** The quote generator was good practice with async functions, DOM manipulation, and working with a simple API.


### Day 36: February 22, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Continued the Scrimba career path today, finishing off the Blogspace API project. Also resumed the FCC JS algorithms and data structures track, getting past 50% of the regex module.

**Thoughts** A day of tutorials and short lessons is tedious. Anxious to get started on another project. But I'd been putting off going back to FCC for a while and I'm happy to begin tackling the regex content, which I'd been low-key avoiding for a while.


### Day 35: February 21, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Several hours working through the Scrimba API module today, getting more practice working with json data as well as some more DOM manipulation and brushing up on HTTP and fetch request methods.

**Thoughts** Looking to pickup the pace with the Scrimba course now and make JavaScript a focus this week before settling on my next frontend mentor project.


### Day 34: February 20, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Finished up my latest Frontend Mentor project, the Art Gallery website. 

**Thoughts** Though this project took a bit longer than I had anticipated, I feel pretty good about the final result. I've managed to match the design comp very closely and had an opportunity to practice some interesting grid and flexbox combinations in order to achieve the layout. I plan to revisit this project in order to integrate an interactive map using a JS library.

### Day 33: February 19, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: After a day off to celebrate the Wife's B-day, back at it today with the Art Gallery website, nearly completing the project.

**Thoughts** I'd hoped to finish this project today, but after trying for an hour to get the desktop hero section layout right with my existing Grid framework, I scraped the setup and pivoted to Flexbox, meaning I had to go back and re-work the tablet layout as well. A few hours later, I'm nearly there and shouldn't have any trouble completing the website tomorrow.

### Day 32: February 17, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Another few hours of work on the Art Gallery project today. A lot of trial and era with Grid and Flexbox properties, looking to match the design comp as close as possible.

**Thoughts** I'm spending a lot more time than I probably should have to getting the Art Gallery site wrapped up, but I think a lot of it is artifically inflating the labor, testing out different ways to get the elements to land where they should and settling on what seems like the most straightforward and maintainable solution.

### Day 31: February 16, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Continued working through the Scrimba API module and some additional touch-ups to the Art Gallery website.

**Thoughts** Not a lot of time for coding today, but pleased to be making progress along the Scrimba path.


### Day 30: February 15, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: A few more hours on the Art Gallery project, finishing up nearly all of the location page, working to get the finished site as pixel perfect with the design comp as possible.

**Thoughts** Getting close to finished with the Art Gallery site and pretty pleased with how it's turning out in general.

### Day 29: February 14, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Began working through the next Scrimba module on APIs and put more work into the Gallery website project, getting most of the location page mobile layout in-place.

**Thoughts** Limited time today, but happy that I'm past 50% through with the Gallery website and have gotten the next Scrimba module started.


### Day 28: February 13, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Another couple hours dedicated to the Art Gallery project, finishing up the home page on mobile.

**Thoughts** Again, I'm seeing the value of carefully planning out the design system and organizing the markup in advance of starting to style the page in earnest. I rushed to get started with this project and am paying the price in going back and reworking some elements of the markup that weren't thought out enough in the beginning. Lesson learned.

### Day 27: February 12, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Worked more on the Art Gallery website project, getting the mobile header section to design specs, adding more to the general styles from the design system.

**Thoughts** This site is definitely presenting some layout challenges and taking quite a bit of time to get things working properly. It's a great learning opportunity.


### Day 26: February 11, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on my latest Frontend Mentor challenge project today, the Art Gallery website. Would have liked to have gotten farther along, but some technical difficulties with my external monitor setup derailed me. Back at it tomorrow!

**Thoughts** The gallery project presents some intesting layout challenges that are going to test my CSS skills. But the finished website is going to be attractive and more satisifying, I think, than the last one.

### Day 25: February 10, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Pac-Man game tutorial through Scrimba

**Thoughts** The Pac-Man game was somewhat interesting as a means of reinforcing some fundamental JS concepts and techniques, but I found the that the instruction provided included a lot of gaps, some missing context and explanation, and generally felt a bit dated in the methodology. I might revist the code later to spruce it up a bit.


### Day 24: February 9, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Made progress on the Scrimba JavaScript Pac-Man game and started a new Frontend Mentor challenge project - Art Gallery Website

**Thoughts** A lot of the Pac-Man game thus far has been review of concepts I've covered before, but putting them together in a new way. It's great practice to continue getting familiar with core JS concepts and applying them to different solutions. The Art Gallery project is going to be a good follow-up to the Wes Bos CSS Grid course, as a lot of the layout looks very grid'ish.


### Day 23: February 8, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Wes Bos CSS Grid course and did a few JS exercies on Launch School.

**Thoughts** Limited time and energy today, a bit under the weather.


### Day 22: February 7, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Spent some more time with the Wes Bos CSS Grid course before moving over to resume the Scrimba frontend dev career path, beginning to build a Pac-Man game with JavaScript.

**Thoughts** Not a lot of dedicated time for coding today, but happy to get back to the Scrimba course after stepping away for a few days. I'm hoping to finish up the path within the next two months so I'll need to pick up the pace a bit.


### Day 21: February 6, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Finished up the final project in the Skillcrush JavaScript course, the GitHub Repo Gallery page that pulls from GitHub's API.

**Thoughts** This was a fun project and great practice for working with APIs and a bit of dynamic page manipulation. Looking forward to applying some of these techniques to future projects from Frontend Mentor.

2. [GitHub Repo Gallery - Live Site](https://mattpahuta.github.io/github-repo-gallery/)

### Day 20: February 5, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: 20% of the way there! Light day today, but did manage some more work through the Wes Bos CSS Grid course and a handful of JS exercises through Launch School.

**Thoughts** Everyday isn't going to be a major milestone, but happy to keep to the commitment and get at least a little meaningful work in.


### Day 19: February 4, Friday

**Today's Progress**: More of the same today. Spent about an hour working through some JS challenges over at Scrimba before pivoting to the Skillcrush JS, getting closer to finishing the GitHub repo project.

**Thoughts** The GitHub repo project has been great practice working with APIs and getting the hang of writing async functions, parsing specific data to use on the web page. Really looking forward to wrapping this project up and quickly moving on to another similar project that features the same sort of requirements.


### Day 18: February 3, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Worked through more JS exercises on Scrimba and began the final project in the Skillcrush JS course, working with the GitHub api and writing async functions and populating the DOM with pulled data. 

**Thoughts** Still grinding. Happy to have another JS project underway to balance out the general practice exercises and study.

### Day 17: February 2, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Worked through some review JS problems at Launch School, finished up more JS exercises over at Scrimba, and spent a bit of time watching the Wes Bos CSS Grid course, thinking about my next Frontend Mentor challenge.

**Thoughts** The day right after finishing a project always feels a little challenging, difficult not to feel something of a let down. This 100 days challenge is definitely helping to push through and stay on task.

### Day 16: February 1, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed a HTML/CSS design challenge from frontend mentor. 

**Thoughts** These projects are just so invaluable to solidifying fundamental concepts, particularly with layouts and various CSS properties. They can be time-consuming, but I feel like it's well worth the effort and time.

1. [Frontend Mentor Meet Landing Page Challenge](https://mattpahuta.github.io/meet-landing-page/)


### Day 15: January 31, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Another couple of hours dedicated to the Meet Landing page project, finishing up the mobile layout and styles.

**Thoughts** Turns out this layout is simple enough that flexbox alone will handle everything I need it to do. Sometimes I jump to overcomplicating things when a more simple route is the best option. I need to keep remining myself of that particular pitfall. Complexity can come later, if needed.

### Day 14: January 30, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: More work on the Meet landing page project, tweaking general styles and begining layout, using mobile-first methodology.

**Thoughts** Figuring out where best to use grid and where to use flex, combination of the two.


### Day 13: January 29, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Continued work on the Meet landing page project, adding more styles and additional markup for the design spec.

**Thoughts** More of the same, working to get more efficient with CSS styling.


### Day 12: January 28, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Spent some time working through Scrimba, reviewing JS ES6, and then pivoted to revisiting another frontend mentor project, the Meet Landing Page.

**Thoughts** I really need to figure out how to start refining my process of starting a new web page project, particularly organizing the styles and custom properties. It's really time consuming and I know I'm not all that efficient. Continuing to do Frontend Mentor projects should really help here to get that muscle memory going and build some better habits.


### Day 11: January 27, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the guess-th-word game project from Skillcrush JS Fundamentals and published to GitHub pages. Most of the work was adding in the game reset/restart functionality, hooking up a new event listener, and some general code tiddying up. 

**Thoughts** This project was fun to see come to life, but did contain a fair amount of hand-holding. It will be good to try and recreate a similar web app away from the tutorial in order to help set some of the concepts in my mind.

### Day 10: January 26, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Nearly completed the Skillcrush word guessing game project, adding dynamic elements and most of the needed DOM features. More practice with loops, conditionals, string/array methods, and a bit of async functions. I should wrap this up tomorrow and get it uploaded to GitHub pages.

**Thoughts** Found that I tend to outthink myself when working through some of the logic in these projects, like reaching for more complex array methods when a more straightforward loop with a conditional is all I needed. I need to keep reminding myself to stick with the fundamentals and keep getting comfortable with those before trying to get too cute.

1. [Skillcrush Guess-the-Word Project](https://github.com/MattPahuta/guess-the-word)



### Day 9: January 25, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Built most of the logic for a word guessing game using vanilla JavaScript, pulling together a lot of fundamental JS concepts and DOM manipulation.

**Thoughts** The Skillcrush project has been a good mix of fundamental JS concepts (arrays, functions, DOM manipulation, etc.) and giving me more practice at distilling problems down into smaller bits to tackle and then fitting it all together into a cohesive web app. Hoping to wrap up this project tomorrow.

### Day 8: January 24, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Finished module 5 of the Scrimba frontend dev career path with a few more responsive design challenges and a bit of JavaScript. Finished the the last two Skillcrush JS exercises, focussed on async/await functions, interacting with APIs.

**Thoughts**  Ready to start in on the next big Skillcrush JS project tomorrow, supplementing with continued work along the Scrimba path and Colt Steele's Udemy JS course. Looking forward to doing more project-oriented work in the weeks ahead.

### Day 7: January 23, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Worked through module 5 of the Scrimba frontend dev career path, responsive design challenges. 

**Thoughts** Starting to get more comfortable with CSS specificity principles and learned about a new CSS property, currentColor.


### Day 6: January 22, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Finished up that snake game over on Scrimba, which was the last bit of module 4 of the frontend dev path. Also checked out Just JavaScript (I'm intrigued) and moved some local VS code over to Codepen.

**Thoughts** Feeling pretty good about the Scrimba path and confident I'll be able to finish the whole thing within a couple months, give or take.

2. [CSS Grid Responsive Image Cards](https://codepen.io/mattpahuta/pen/yLzmKwQ)


### Day 5: January 21, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Worked through about half of the Scrimba JS Fundamentals build a snake game project.

**Thoughts** Crunched for time today but managed about 1.5 hours of coding. I'll need to go back and take a closer look at the function we're using to manage the movement in the game. The math principles are simple enough, but some elements weren't quite clicking during the first pass.


### Day 4: January 20, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Continued to practice JS fundamentals with the Launch School JS100 prep exercises and worked through some async function exercises for the Skillcrush JavaScript course.

**Thoughts** Working with APIs, actually getting some dynamic data back from the JS code I write, turns out is pretty fun. Looking forward to nailing down the syntax with some more practice and figuring out some fun personal projects to work on.

### Day 3: January 19, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Built a simple dice game with Scrimba using vanilla JavaScript and brushed up on some CSS Grid fundamentals via Kevin Powell's YouTube channel.

**Thoughts** 

**Link(s) to work**
1. [JavaScript Dice Game]()


### Day 2: January 18, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Review of async/await JavaScript via Skillcrush and some brushing up on CSS Grid with Wes Bos's Grid course and building a quick, responsive gallery with Grid, working off of Kevin Powell's YouTube channel offerings.

**Thoughts** Working with data through APIs is something I really need and want to focus on over the next few months. The Skillcrush course is providing a nice re-entry into some concepts I haven't looked at in a while.


### Day 1: January 17, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Kicked things off with a slew of exercises in the Skillcrush JavaScript module as well as some review of JS fundamentals with the Launch School JS prep material.

**Thoughts** New year, renewed commitment. Day one of a hundred days straight of coding in the books! A focus on sharpening my responsive design, CSS, modern JavaScript, and React skills are all in order. I've been working with HTML, CSS, and a little bit of JavaScript and jQuery for a while, but it's time to really commit to ramping up my code skills and moving beyond the basics, heading toward a new career in software development.
