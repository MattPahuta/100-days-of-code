# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 17, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Kicked things off with a slew of exercises in the Skillcrush JavaScript module as well as some review of JS fundamentals with the Launch School JS prep material.

**Thoughts** New year, renewed commitment. Day one of a hundred days straight of coding in the books! A focus on sharpening my responsive design, CSS, modern JavaScript, and React skills are all in order. I've been working with HTML, CSS, and a little bit of JavaScript and jQuery for a while, but it's time to really commit to ramping up my code skills and moving beyond the basics, heading toward a new career in software development.

### Day 2: January 18, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Review of async/await JavaScript via Skillcrush and some brushing up on CSS Grid with Wes Bos's Grid course and building a quick, responsive gallery with Grid, working off of Kevin Powell's YouTube channel offerings.

**Thoughts** Working with data through APIs is something I really need and want to focus on over the next few months. The Skillcrush course is providing a nice re-entry into some concepts I haven't looked at in a while.

### Day 4: January 20, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Continued to practice JS fundamentals with the Launch School JS100 prep exercises and worked through some async function exercises for the Skillcrush JavaScript course.

**Thoughts** Working with APIs, actually getting some dynamic data back from the JS code I write, turns out is pretty fun. Looking forward to nailing down the syntax with some more practice and figuring out some fun personal projects to work on.
