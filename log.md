# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 28: February 13, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Another couple hours dedicated to the Art Gallery project, finishing up the home page on mobile.

**Thoughts** Again, I'm seeing the value of carefully planning out the design system and organizing the markup in advance of starting to style the page in earnest. I rushed to get started with this project and am paying the price in going back and reworking some elements of the markup that weren't thought out enough in the beginning. Lesson learned.

### Day 27: February 12, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Worked more on the Art Gallery website project, getting the mobile header section to design specs, adding more to the general styles from the design system.

**Thoughts** This site is definitely presenting some layout challenges and taking quite a bit of time to get things working properly. It's a great learning opportunity.


### Day 26: February 11, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on my latest Frontend Mentor challenge project today, the Art Gallery website. Would have liked to have gotten farther along, but some technical difficulties with my external monitor setup derailed me. Back at it tomorrow!

**Thoughts** The gallery project presents some intesting layout challenges that are going to test my CSS skills. But the finished website is going to be attractive and more satisifying, I think, than the last one.

### Day 25: February 10, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Pac-Man game tutorial through Scrimba

**Thoughts** The Pac-Man game was somewhat interesting as a means of reinforcing some fundamental JS concepts and techniques, but I found the that the instruction provided included a lot of gaps, some missing context and explanation, and generally felt a bit dated in the methodology. I might revist the code later to spruce it up a bit.


### Day 24: February 9, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Made progress on the Scrimba JavaScript Pac-Man game and started a new Frontend Mentor challenge project - Art Gallery Website

**Thoughts** A lot of the Pac-Man game thus far has been review of concepts I've covered before, but putting them together in a new way. It's great practice to continue getting familiar with core JS concepts and applying them to different solutions. The Art Gallery project is going to be a good follow-up to the Wes Bos CSS Grid course, as a lot of the layout looks very grid'ish.


### Day 23: February 8, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Wes Bos CSS Grid course and did a few JS exercies on Launch School.

**Thoughts** Limited time and energy today, a bit under the weather.


### Day 22: February 7, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Spent some more time with the Wes Bos CSS Grid course before moving over to resume the Scrimba frontend dev career path, beginning to build a Pac-Man game with JavaScript.

**Thoughts** Not a lot of dedicated time for coding today, but happy to get back to the Scrimba course after stepping away for a few days. I'm hoping to finish up the path within the next two months so I'll need to pick up the pace a bit.


### Day 21: February 6, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Finished up the final project in the Skillcrush JavaScript course, the GitHub Repo Gallery page that pulls from GitHub's API.

**Thoughts** This was a fun project and great practice for working with APIs and a bit of dynamic page manipulation. Looking forward to applying some of these techniques to future projects from Frontend Mentor.

### Day 20: February 5, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: 20% of the way there! Light day today, but did manage some more work through the Wes Bos CSS Grid course and a handful of JS exercises through Launch School.

**Thoughts** Everyday isn't going to be a major milestone, but happy to keep to the commitment and get at least a little meaningful work in.


### Day 19: February 4, Friday

**Today's Progress**: More of the same today. Spent about an hour working through some JS challenges over at Scrimba before pivoting to the Skillcrush JS, getting closer to finishing the GitHub repo project.

**Thoughts** The GitHub repo project has been great practice working with APIs and getting the hang of writing async functions, parsing specific data to use on the web page. Really looking forward to wrapping this project up and quickly moving on to another similar project that features the same sort of requirements.


### Day 18: February 3, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Worked through more JS exercises on Scrimba and began the final project in the Skillcrush JS course, working with the GitHub api and writing async functions and populating the DOM with pulled data. 

**Thoughts** Still grinding. Happy to have another JS project underway to balance out the general practice exercises and study.

### Day 17: February 2, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Worked through some review JS problems at Launch School, finished up more JS exercises over at Scrimba, and spent a bit of time watching the Wes Bos CSS Grid course, thinking about my next Frontend Mentor challenge.

**Thoughts** The day right after finishing a project always feels a little challenging, difficult not to feel something of a let down. This 100 days challenge is definitely helping to push through and stay on task.

### Day 16: February 1, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed a HTML/CSS design challenge from frontend mentor. 

**Thoughts** These projects are just so invaluable to solidifying fundamental concepts, particularly with layouts and various CSS properties. They can be time-consuming, but I feel like it's well worth the effort and time.

1. [Frontend Mentor Meet Landing Page Challenge](https://mattpahuta.github.io/meet-landing-page/)


### Day 15: January 31, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Another couple of hours dedicated to the Meet Landing page project, finishing up the mobile layout and styles.

**Thoughts** Turns out this layout is simple enough that flexbox alone will handle everything I need it to do. Sometimes I jump to overcomplicating things when a more simple route is the best option. I need to keep remining myself of that particular pitfall. Complexity can come later, if needed.

### Day 14: January 30, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: More work on the Meet landing page project, tweaking general styles and begining layout, using mobile-first methodology.

**Thoughts** Figuring out where best to use grid and where to use flex, combination of the two.


### Day 13: January 29, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Continued work on the Meet landing page project, adding more styles and additional markup for the design spec.

**Thoughts** More of the same, working to get more efficient with CSS styling.


### Day 12: January 28, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Spent some time working through Scrimba, reviewing JS ES6, and then pivoted to revisiting another frontend mentor project, the Meet Landing Page.

**Thoughts** I really need to figure out how to start refining my process of starting a new web page project, particularly organizing the styles and custom properties. It's really time consuming and I know I'm not all that efficient. Continuing to do Frontend Mentor projects should really help here to get that muscle memory going and build some better habits.


### Day 11: January 27, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the guess-th-word game project from Skillcrush JS Fundamentals and published to GitHub pages. Most of the work was adding in the game reset/restart functionality, hooking up a new event listener, and some general code tiddying up. 

**Thoughts** This project was fun to see come to life, but did contain a fair amount of hand-holding. It will be good to try and recreate a similar web app away from the tutorial in order to help set some of the concepts in my mind.

### Day 10: January 26, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Nearly completed the Skillcrush word guessing game project, adding dynamic elements and most of the needed DOM features. More practice with loops, conditionals, string/array methods, and a bit of async functions. I should wrap this up tomorrow and get it uploaded to GitHub pages.

**Thoughts** Found that I tend to outthink myself when working through some of the logic in these projects, like reaching for more complex array methods when a more straightforward loop with a conditional is all I needed. I need to keep reminding myself to stick with the fundamentals and keep getting comfortable with those before trying to get too cute.

### Day 9: January 25, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Built most of the logic for a word guessing game using vanilla JavaScript, pulling together a lot of fundamental JS concepts and DOM manipulation.

**Thoughts** The Skillcrush project has been a good mix of fundamental JS concepts (arrays, functions, DOM manipulation, etc.) and giving me more practice at distilling problems down into smaller bits to tackle and then fitting it all together into a cohesive web app. Hoping to wrap up this project tomorrow.

### Day 8: January 24, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Finished module 5 of the Scrimba frontend dev career path with a few more responsive design challenges and a bit of JavaScript. Finished the the last two Skillcrush JS exercises, focussed on async/await functions, interacting with APIs.

**Thoughts**  Ready to start in on the next big Skillcrush JS project tomorrow, supplementing with continued work along the Scrimba path and Colt Steele's Udemy JS course. Looking forward to doing more project-oriented work in the weeks ahead.

### Day 7: January 23, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Worked through module 5 of the Scrimba frontend dev career path, responsive design challenges. 

**Thoughts** Starting to get more comfortable with CSS specificity principles and learned about a new CSS property, currentColor.


### Day 6: January 22, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Finished up that snake game over on Scrimba, which was the last bit of module 4 of the frontend dev path. Also checked out Just JavaScript (I'm intrigued) and moved some local VS code over to Codepen.

**Thoughts** Feeling pretty good about the Scrimba path and confident I'll be able to finish the whole thing within a couple months, give or take.

### Day 5: January 21, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Worked through about half of the Scrimba JS Fundamentals build a snake game project.

**Thoughts** Crunched for time today but managed about 1.5 hours of coding. I'll need to go back and take a closer look at the function we're using to manage the movement in the game. The math principles are simple enough, but some elements weren't quite clicking during the first pass.


### Day 4: January 20, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Continued to practice JS fundamentals with the Launch School JS100 prep exercises and worked through some async function exercises for the Skillcrush JavaScript course.

**Thoughts** Working with APIs, actually getting some dynamic data back from the JS code I write, turns out is pretty fun. Looking forward to nailing down the syntax with some more practice and figuring out some fun personal projects to work on.

### Day 2: January 18, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Review of async/await JavaScript via Skillcrush and some brushing up on CSS Grid with Wes Bos's Grid course and building a quick, responsive gallery with Grid, working off of Kevin Powell's YouTube channel offerings.

**Thoughts** Working with data through APIs is something I really need and want to focus on over the next few months. The Skillcrush course is providing a nice re-entry into some concepts I haven't looked at in a while.


### Day 1: January 17, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Kicked things off with a slew of exercises in the Skillcrush JavaScript module as well as some review of JS fundamentals with the Launch School JS prep material.

**Thoughts** New year, renewed commitment. Day one of a hundred days straight of coding in the books! A focus on sharpening my responsive design, CSS, modern JavaScript, and React skills are all in order. I've been working with HTML, CSS, and a little bit of JavaScript and jQuery for a while, but it's time to really commit to ramping up my code skills and moving beyond the basics, heading toward a new career in software development.
